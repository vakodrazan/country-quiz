As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...

Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify and explain briefly what you have done.

For the custom domain url you'll enter in netlify, please use the following naming convention : **country-quiz-_YOUR_FIRSTNAME_.netlify.app** (replace YOUR_FIRSTNAME by your firstname)

Good luck everybody!

 ### Where can I see your demo?

You can find my demo in [country-quiz](https://country-quiz-noeline.netlify.app/).

 ### What was your experience?

 -It was hard to fetch the data from the API. 
 - I noticed that we need to run the random just once at the beginning. 
 - Also, we need to be creative to get the flag and the capital randomly.
 - I had a trouble to get each attribute from each object. But then, I noticed that I need to pass an argument and a parameter when calling it.

 ### What have you learned/improved?
 - I have learnt how to random and only show four of the item form a 250 item from the API. 
 - I learnt that we can have an `ol` or `ul` that has a different type such as `type="A"`.
 - Before it was not clear for me how to use index when mapping. But in this project, sometime I got two item that has the same key so I have to find out what I should do to avoid that. Then I came up with an idea that I could use the unique code and add the index with it.

 ### Your wisdom? :)

 - It was hard to get that render. Especially, to get the question and the right value of that.
 - This project taught me to think before coding because there are some logic we need to know before delving into code.
 - I try to use hook context but I there was a problem with it.
 - I also tried to add an alphabet with the option list but it didn't work.
